  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p1>
    Our system is a secure and efficient digital voting platform developed specifical
    ly for university elections. Whether it's student council,
    departmental representati<br>
    ves, or club leadership,our goal is to simplify the voting process for both student
    s and administrators. By moving elections online, we eliminate the need for paper<br> ballot
    s and physical polling stations,
    making participation easier and more accessible for
    everyone on campus</p1>

  <br><br>

  <p2>Designed with user-friendliness in mind, the system allows students to log in secure
    ly, view candidate profiles, and cast their votes with just a few clicks. We use
    strong <br>authentication and encryption to ensure that every vote is confidential and
    tamper-proof. The platform also provides real-time vote counting and instant result
    generation,<br> helping maintain transparency and trust throughout the election
    process.</p2>

  <br><br>

  <p3>Our mission is to promote fair, inclusive, and technologically advanced elections
    within the university communityâ€”giving every student a voice and making every
    vote count</p3>
